<div align="center"><p font-size:8em;>Notes on this Fork</p></div> 
This fork is meant to suggest some code improvements and try to pay off old technical debt. This will help in the future to make it much easier to port to later versions of Epic Fight.
Additionally JVN has the final say if any of these code improvements would be implemented into the main branch since I'm primarily here to provide just a more readable and intutive code that makes it easy to port to later versions.
